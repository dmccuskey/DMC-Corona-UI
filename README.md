# Overview #

The **DMC Corona UI** library is collection of advanced widgets for the Corona SDK. They can be used in any size or type of application.

The module architecture is heavily object-oriented, but each module can be used with any style of coding. The OO-nature ensures that the modules can be easily re-used or modified as necessary.

**Features**

* Robust and efficient widgets
* Cascading style sheets
* Powerful controls

**Documentation & Examples**

There are examples and documentation available for the modules. Look in the `examples` folder for available examples which can be run directly in the Corona SDK. Documentation and some simple screencasts of examples are online at: [docs.davidmccuskey.com](http://docs.davidmccuskey.com/dmc+corona+ui)
