# Overview #

The DMC Corona UI library is collection of advanced widgets for the Corona SDK. They can be used in any size or type of application.

The module architecture is heavily object-oriented, but each module can be used with any style of coding. The OO-nature ensures that the modules can be easily re-used or modified as necessary.


**Documentation & Examples**

There are examples and documentation available for the modules. Look in the `examples` folder for available examples which can be run directly in the Corona SDK. Documentation is online at: [docs.davidmccuskey.com](http://docs.davidmccuskey.com/dmc+corona+ui)

## Installation & Use ##

For easy installation, copy the following items to the same location anywhere in your Corona project.

* The entire `dmc_corona` folder
* The entire `dmc_ui` folder
* The `dmc_ui.lua` file


As in the examples, if you placed both items inside of a directory `lib`, the widgets module would be imported like so:

```lua
local dUI = require 'lib.dmc_ui'

local button = dUI.newPushButton( params )
...
```


The library has been designed to give a lot of flexibility where it is stored in your project. For more information regarding the library and individual widgets, visit [DMC Corona UI](http://docs.davidmccuskey.com/dmc+corona+ui).
